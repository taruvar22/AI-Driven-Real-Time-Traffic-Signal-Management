ðŸŒŸ Smart Traffic Light Control Using Real-Time AI Optimization
This project implements an intelligent traffic signal control system that dynamically adjusts signal timings using multiple AI algorithms to optimize traffic flow at intersections. The system responds to real-time vehicle density changes to reduce congestion and improve urban mobility.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Dynamic Signal Timing - AI-driven adjustment of green light durations

Multiple Algorithm Options - Choose from 3 distinct optimization approaches

Configurable Simulation - Customize lanes, traffic patterns, and timing parameters

Extensible Architecture - Easy to integrate with real sensors or traffic APIs

Visual Feedback - Console-based visualization of traffic states
